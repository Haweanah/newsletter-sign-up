### Built With

- React (Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Component-based architecture

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of:

- **Lifting state up** in React
- Conditional rendering using boolean state
- Conditional Rendering – Displaying UI elements based on       boolean state
- Controlled Components – Managing input values in React forms
- Form Validation – Implementing custom email validation with regex
- Component Communication – Passing functions as props
- Reusable Components – Structuring maintainable, modular React components
- UI State Transitions – Switching between form and success message views

---

🔮 Future Improvements

- Add animations for transitions between form and success screen

- Integrate server-side form handling for real email subscriptions

- Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes

- Add unit tests for form validation logic
